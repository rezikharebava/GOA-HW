            <div class="description">Mercedes-Benz (German pronunciation: [mɛʁˌtse:dəs 'bɛnts, -dɛs -] ⓘ),[6][7]
                commonly
                referred to simply as Mercedes and occasionally as Benz, is a German automotive brand that was founded
                in 1926.
                Mercedes-Benz AG (a subsidiary of the Mercedes-Benz Group, established in 2019) is based in Stuttgart,
                Baden-Württemberg, Germany.[1] Mercedes-Benz AG manufactures luxury vehicles and light commercial
                vehicles, all
                branded under the Mercedes-Benz name. From November 2019 onwards, the production of
                Mercedes-Benz-branded heavy
                commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) has been managed by Daimler Truck, which separated from the
                Mercedes-Benz
                Group to form an independent entity at the end of 2021.

                In 2018, Mercedes-Benz became the world's largest premium vehicle brand, with a sales volume of 2.31
                million
                passenger cars.[8]

                The roots of the brand trace back to the 1901 Mercedes by Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft and the 1886 Benz
                Patent-Motorwagen and 1894 Benz Velo by Carl Benz, which is widely recognized as the first automobile
                powered by
                an internal combustion engine. The brand's slogan is "The Best or Nothing".[9]</div>

                    BMW Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, trading as BMW Group (commonly abbreviated to BMW
                    (German pronunciation:
                    [ˌbe:?ɛm've:] ⓘ), sometimes anglicised as Bavarian Motor Works), is a German multinational
                    manufacturer of
                    vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The company was founded in 1916
                    as a
                    manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 to 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945,
                    creating
                    engines for aircraft that were used in the Second World War.

                    The company's automobiles are marketed under the BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands, and motorcycles
                    are
                    marketed
                    under the BMW Motorrad brand. In 2023, BMW was the world's ninth-largest producer of motor vehicles,
                    and the
                    6th
                    largest by revenue,[3] with 2,555,341 vehicles produced in that year alone.[4] In 2023, the company
                    was ranked
                    46th in the Forbes Global 2000.[5] The company has significant motor-sport history, especially in
                    touring
                    cars,
                    sports cars, and the Isle of Man TT.

                    BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany, the United Kingdom, the
                    United States,
                    Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, India, China, and previously also in the Netherlands (ceased in
                    2023).[6] The
                    Quandt family [de] is a long-term shareholder of the company, following investments by the brothers
                    Herbert
                    and
                    Harald Quandt in 1959 that saved BMW from bankruptcy, with remaining shares owned by the public.

            <div class="description">Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.[b] is a Japanese multinational automobile manufacturer
                headquartered in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. The company sells its vehicles under the Nissan and Infiniti
                brands,
                and formerly the Datsun brand, with in-house performance tuning products (including cars) under the
                Nismo and
                Autech brands. The company traces back to the beginnings of the 20th century, with the Nissan zaibatsu
                or called
                Nissan Group.

                Since 1999, Nissan has been part of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance (Mitsubishi joining in 2016),
                a
                partnership between Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, with Renault of France. As of November 2023,
                Renault
                holds a 15% voting stake in Nissan, while Nissan holds the same stake in Renault.[8] Since October 2016,
                Nissan
                held a 34% controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors.[9] In November 2024, Nissan reduced its stake in
                Mitsubishi
                Motors from 34% to 24%.[10] Nissan planned to merge with Honda Motor Company in 2026, after an
                announcement in
                December 2024.[11] However by February 2025, Nissan announced it would abandon merger plans as the
                automaker
                stated that it wanted to become an equal partner to Honda rather than a subsidiary.[12] In November
                2024, a
                Nissan executive was quoted as saying that the company had as little as 12 months left to live, barring
                any
                major events.[13] As of 2025, Nissan is having major financial issues.[14]

                In 2017, Nissan was the sixth largest automaker in the world, after Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai
                Motor
                Group, General Motors and Ford.[15] With a revenue of $78 billion in 2022, Nissan was the ninth largest
                automobile maker in the world.</div>
