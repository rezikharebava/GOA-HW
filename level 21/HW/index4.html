            <p class="p-1">Life of Pi is a 2012 adventure-drama film directed and produced by Ang Lee and written by
                David
                Magee. Based on Yann Martel's 2001 novel, it stars Suraj Sharma in his film debut, Irrfan Khan, Tabu,
                Rafe
                Spall, Gérard Depardieu and Adil Hussain in lead roles. The storyline revolves around two survivors of a
                shipwreck who are on a lifeboat stranded in the Pacific Ocean for 227 days. One is a sixteen-year-old
                Indian boy
                named Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) and the other is a ferocious Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.

                The film began development shortly after the release of the book and would see directors M. Night
                Shyamalan,
                Alfonso Cuarón and Jean-Pierre Jeunet involved at various stages before the hiring of Lee. Filming was
                split
                between India, Taiwan and Montreal in 2011, with Rhythm & Hues Studios (R&H) handling the visual effects
                work.

                The film had its worldwide premiere as the opening film of the 50th New York Film Festival at both the
                Walter
                Reade Theater and Alice Tully Hall in New York City on September 28, 2012. It was theatrically released
                in the
                U.S. on November 21 by 20th Century Fox. Life of Pi became a commercial success, having grossed over
                $609
                million, and received generally positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for three Golden Globe
                Awards,
                including Best Picture – Drama and Best Director, and won for Golden Globe Award for Best Original
                Score. At the
                85th Academy Awards, it had eleven nominations, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, and
                won
                four, including Best Director for Ang Lee.</p>
