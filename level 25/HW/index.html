    <p class="p-1">The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus),[4] also known as the polar owl, the white owl and the
        Arctic owl,[5]
        is a large, white owl of the true owl family.[6] Snowy owls are native to the Arctic regions of both
        North America and the Palearctic, breeding mostly on the tundra.[2] It has a number of unique
        adaptations to its habitat and lifestyle, which are quite distinct from other extant owls.[7] One of
        the largest species of owl, it is the only owl with mainly white plumage.[6] Males tend to be a
        purer white overall while females tend to have more extensive flecks of dark brown.[8] Juvenile male
        snowy owls have dark markings that may appear similar to females until maturity, at which point they
        typically turn whiter. The composition of brown markings about the wing, although not foolproof, is
        the most reliable technique to age and sex individual snowy owls.[9]: 48 

        Most owls sleep during the day and hunt at night, but the snowy owl is often active during the day,
        especially in the summertime.[7] The snowy owl is both a specialized and generalist hunter. Its
        breeding efforts and global population are closely tied to the availability of tundra-dwelling
        lemmings, but in the non-breeding season, and occasionally during breeding, the snowy owl can adapt
        to almost any available prey – most often other small mammals and northerly water birds, as well as,
        opportunistically, carrion.[5][8] Snowy owls typically nest on a small rise on the ground of the
        tundra.[10] The snowy owl lays a very large clutch of eggs, often from about 5 to 11, with the
        laying and hatching of eggs considerably staggered.[8] Despite the short Arctic summer, the
        development of the young takes a relatively long time and independence is sought in autumn.[7]</p>
