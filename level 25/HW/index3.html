    <h1>Georgian regions</h1>
    <p>Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო, romanized: sakartvelo, IPA: [sakʰartʰʷelo] ⓘ) is a transcontinental country in
        Eastern Europe[10][11][12] and West Asia. It is part of the Caucasus region, bounded by the Black Sea to the
        west, Russia to the north and northeast, Turkey to the southwest, Armenia to the south, and Azerbaijan to the
        southeast. Georgia covers an area of 69,700 square kilometres (26,900 sq mi).[13] It has a population of 3.7
        million,[b][14] of which over a third live in the capital and largest city, Tbilisi. Georgians, who are native
        to the region, constitute a majority of the country's population and are its titular nation.

        Georgia has been inhabited since prehistory, hosting the world's earliest known sites of winemaking, gold
        mining, and textiles.[15][16] The classical era saw the emergence of several kingdoms, such as Colchis and
        Iberia, that formed the nucleus of the modern Georgian state. In the early fourth century, Georgians officially
        adopted Christianity, which contributed to the unification into the Kingdom of Georgia. Georgia reached its
        Golden Age during the High Middle Ages under the reigns of King David IV and Queen Tamar. Beginning in the 15th
        century, the kingdom declined and disintegrated under pressure from various regional powers, including the
        Mongols, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia, before being gradually annexed into the Russian Empire starting in
        1801.

        After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgia briefly emerged as an independent republic under German
        protection,[17] but was invaded and annexed by the Red Army in 1921, becoming one of the Republics of the Soviet
        Union. In the 1980s, an independence movement grew quickly, leading to Georgia's secession from the Soviet Union
        in April 1991. For much of the subsequent decade, the country endured economic crises, political instability,
        and secessionist wars in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Following the peaceful Rose Revolution in 2003, Georgia
        strongly pursued a pro-Western foreign policy, introducing a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at
        integration into the European Union and NATO. This Western orientation led to worsening relations with Russia,
        culminating in the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 and continued Russian occupation of parts of Georgia.</p>
