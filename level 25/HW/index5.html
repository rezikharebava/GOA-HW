    <h1>well you just wait</h1>
    <p>n 1968-1969, the director of the Soyuzmultfilm film studio, Mikhail Valkov, asked young humorist writers:
        Alexander Kurlyandsky , Felix Kamov , Arkady Khait and Eduard Uspensky to come up with a funny script for a
        cartoon for children . [ 1 ]

        In 1969, Kurlyandsky and Khait came up with a plot. They decided that it should be a chase film. They chose who
        would chase whom. They went through different characters: at first they wanted to take a fox and a rooster, then
        a fox and a hare, and finally settled on a wolf and a hare, as the most familiar characters in Russian folklore
        [ 2 ] [ unreliable source ] .

        The team of scriptwriters had to implement the idea in one of the stories of the film magazine " Veselaya
        Karusel " No. 1. In the course of thinking about the phrase-threat of the Wolf, which was supposed to become a
        link between two different episodes, the phrase "Well, just you wait!" was chosen [ 1 ] . It also became part of
        the title of the 2.5-minute cartoon, the director and artist of which was at that time still little-known
        Gennady Sokolsky .

        After the release of the cartoon, the studio management suggested that the scriptwriters make a longer,
        10-minute film. However, they needed a director with experience, since Gennady Sokolsky was still a newbie in
        this business. The scriptwriters, of whom there were three left due to the departure of Eduard Uspensky, looked
        for him for a long time, since everyone refused the project, considering its idea shallow. Only Vyacheslav
        Kotyonochkin did not turn away . After reading the script and meeting with the authors again, he said: "There is
        something in this" [ 1 ] .

        The production designer was Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin's long-time companion, Svetozar Rusakov . The voice of the
        Wolf was given by theater and film actor Anatoly Papanov , who had previously worked with the director in the
        cartoon " Mezha " (the role of the Serpent Gorynych), and the voice of the Hare was given by Klara Rumyanova ,
        who had worked with the director in the cartoon " Traces on the Asphalt " (partially the role of the puppy). The
        film "Well, Just You Wait!" was not the first time the actors met. They had previously worked together in the
        cartoons: " Whose Cones in the Forest? " (the roles of the wolf and the fox, respectively), " The Fox, the Bear,
        and the Motorcycle with a Sidecar " (the roles of the bear and the fox, respectively), and "The Sunny Grain"
        (the roles of the octopus and the shell, respectively).

        Initially, Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin wanted to hear Vladimir Vysotsky in the role of the Wolf . The singer, having
        read the script, was eager not only to voice the character, but also to write a song for him. However, Vysotsky,
        who was among the undesirable artists, was not approved for the role [ 3 ] .

        The cartoon was finished at the end of 1969, and on January 30, 1970, it was issued a distribution certificate [
        4 ] . According to Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin, the discussion of the film at the artistic council went relatively
        smoothly. However, the director was offended by a remark by Fyodor Khitruk , who saw in the cartoon a deviation
        from tradition, an imitation of not the best American cinema and the presence of something vulgar. However, in
        1986, the creator of Boniface's Vacation and Winnie the Pooh, highly appreciating Well, Just You Wait!, noted
        "the filigree of each trick" [ 5 ] . After watching the film, the scriptwriters thought it was a complete
        failure, but the audience success was resounding. Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin's son, director Alexei Kotyonochkin ,
        recalled [ 6 ] : "The people were crying with laughter even before the Wolf did anything on camera. The
        romantic, gangster hero turned out to be incredibly close to everyone... I personally watched as the lady in the
        front row at the Barrikady movie theater fell off her chair and convulsed with laughter."</p>
